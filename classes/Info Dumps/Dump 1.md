-The web we know started as CERN. (Minor note)

-Original intention was information exchange anywhere in the world. (Foundation of internet)

-The DOM: Document Object Model; is a nested way of displaying information the whole HTML code block is the DOM.

  

Document

Root element - <html>

Element - <head> store information on how browsers load information or how links store information.

Element - <body> - actual content of the page

  

CSS= Cascading Style Sheets

Cascade = things can override other things, layers can layer over each other with layers with highest rules getting priority. As you write down the code-block in CSS it will layer over what was previously written (thatâ€™s the layer with highest rules without SPECIFICITY).
  

Giving an element a class in HTML is like giving an element a name so that you can target that specific element in CSS, anything with the same class name will be targeted the same in CSS.
