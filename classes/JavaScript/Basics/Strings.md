Strings are text or numbers. Text need to be wrapped in `""` or `''` with javaScript.

Numbers don't need to wrapped in quotes and in fact be careful when doing it. Adding quotes to a number in a string will change the functionality of the number.

Examples:

console.log(4+5)=9
console.log("2" +"4")=24
console.log("5" + 1)=51
console.log(100 + "100")=100100

Strings are always going to be considered first versus numbers.
