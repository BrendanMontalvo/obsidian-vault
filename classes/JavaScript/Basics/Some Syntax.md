- getElementById can target a specific element by its ID
- querySelector can do the same thing but needs `"# "` in it's parentheses if using to select an ID.
- `[]` to initiate an array - an ordered list of items - Arrays are <strong><em>ZERO</em></strong> indexed, meaning if you want to grab the first item it starts with zero.
