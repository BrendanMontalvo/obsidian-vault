Creating a function is simple, using `function` we can create a function for any task we need.

Example below:

<!-- create a function that logs out the number 27 to the console

call/invoke the function-->

<code>function logger() {
console.log(27)
}
logger()</code>

It is always important to call a function in order to have it print properly. When creating the variable that represents the function `logger()` it is also called using the name we gave it.
