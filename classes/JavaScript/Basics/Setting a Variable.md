You can use `let` to declare a variable, and then use that variable to do mathematic functions. 

<code>let myLicenseAge = 6</code> 
the code above is declaring the varialbe "myLicenseAge" and setting it equal to 6.

With that variable I can do mathematic equations such as:

<code>let myLicenseAge = 6
let nextDecade = 10

myLicenseInTenYears = myLicenseAge + nextDecade</code>

In order to see it print in the console you would use:

<code>console.log(myLicenseInTenYears)</code>
