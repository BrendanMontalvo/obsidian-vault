- Images are like links
- use "src" = source
- image tags are self-closing but you can close them yourself
- can use file name or external sites, but external sites are bad practice
- Images are not valid without an alt attribute, alt attributes describe an image.
- alt text should describe the intent of the image.
- Do not need to include the words "an image of"
- If it is a decorative element or logo, it doesn't need alt text (but it <em>does</em> still require the alt attribute).
- keep alt="" when no text is necessary
