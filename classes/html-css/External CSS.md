Instead of a style element, where we can write the CSS, we can use a link, which links to our CSS file.

- add the link in the head of our document.
- `<link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet">`
- rel=relationship between the html page and the css page.
- Classes are created using full stop:
- `p.intro {`
- ID's are created by '='
- `<p id="intro">`
- Called using hash
- `#intro {`  
- ID is an individual/Class is a group
-
