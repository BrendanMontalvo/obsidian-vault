In HTML you can comment out text like this:
```html
<!-- This is a comment opening and closing -->
<p>some uncommented html</p>
```

In CSS you can comment out text in two ways:
```css
// you can comment out a single line with two backslashes (I may have lied, this might only work in js/scss)

/*
This is how you can comment out multiple lines at once
*/

div {
  content: 'some uncommented css';
}

```
